Back in 2017, when I was a research assistant at the <a href="">Leibniz Institute for Marine Tropical Research</a> I've spent a few months doing text-mining of published and unpublished (thesis and dissertations) data.

My goal was to compile and organize some important data that was scattered over and inaccessible (published)

After long visits to the Institute's library, and a few months of work, I was able to assemble a structured dataset
The full dataset is fully open-access. It is currently sitting on the and can be downloaded here

> Here a dataset is presented with 2364 records of traits of "true mangroves" species, gathered from 88 references (published articles, books, theses and dissertations). The dataset contains information on 107 quantitative traits and 18 qualitative traits for 55 species of "true mangroves" (sensu Tomlinson 2016). Most traits refer to components of living trees (mainly leaves), but litter traits were also included.

**Here's the link for the full publication (Open-access):**

The dataset is currently stored in **Zenodo**: https://zenodo.org/record/802990

Well, I did this manually and I am very proud of this small contribution. But, why not take this to the next level? What about analyzing 90000 publications, instead of 90? Inspired by the recent advances of **Natural language processing** (NLP), I .
