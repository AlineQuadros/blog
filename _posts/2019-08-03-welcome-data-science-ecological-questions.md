A mix of old and new data analysis tools and how they can be combined to answer cool ecological questions

Hi! My name is Aline, I'm a quantitative ecologist and data scientist (and programmer!). I've been working with various biological datasets over the years and I've used all kinds of tools to collect, analyze, and communicate data. I'm always learning new stuff and thinking about how to improve our ecological knowledge with combinations of new methods.  


I started this blog to share tips and tricks about very useful tools, methods, tests, and resources that I've encountered over the years and how they helped to answer my question. In my experience, most traditional undergrad and graduate statistics courses only tell ecologists about a few "classic" ways of analyzing data. Most modern research questions, however, require a combination of a wider set of methods and skills.  

I started my journey into data analysis a long time ago, as most undergrads do, applying T-tests and ANOVAS to laboratory data and *learning to "love" SPSS*. But it was only during grad school and later as a research scientist that I learned the really cool stuff, like mixed models, path analysis, network analysis, and much more.

Nowadays, I'm exploring the world of *machine learning* with Python and thinking how to apply *artificial intelligence* to solve applied environmental issues. I'm extremely interested in **NLP** (Natural Language Processing) and how it can be used to extract **unstructured information** from scientific literature and convert it into structure datasets that can be mined. I already wrote a post about my first attempt to dive into NLP, which you can read <a href="https://alinequadros.github.io/blog/NLP-knowledge-discovery-science-literature">here</a>. There's much more coming up!
