A mix of old and new data analysis tools and how they can be combined to answer cool ecological questions

Hi! My name is Aline, I'm a quantitative ecologist and data scientist (and programmer!). I've been working with various biological datasets over the years and I've used all kinds of tools to collect, analyze, and communicate data. I'm always learning new stuff and thinking about how to improve our understanding of things with combinations of new methods.  


I started this blog to tell a little bit about very useful tools, methods, tests, and resources that I've encountered over the years and how they helped me. I think that most traditional undergrad and graduate statistics courses only tell ecologists about a few "classic" ways of analyzing data. Most modern research questions, however, require a wider set of methods and skills.  

I started my journey into data analysis a long time ago, as most undergrads do, applying T-tests and ANOVAS to laboratory data and learning to "love" SPSS. But it was only during grad school and later as a research scientists that I learned the really cool stuff, like mixed models, path analysis, network analysis, and much more.


Nowadays, I'm exploring the world of *machine learning* with Python and thinking how to apply *artificial inteligence* to solve applied environmental issues.
