Environmental health can be accessed by monitoring multiple features, the biological indicators. PCAs can help to detect and visualize trends over time


To access the health of rivers, or water quality, for instance, it might not be enough just to know that the concentration of nitrates is decreasing, or that the dissolved oxygen is increasing. The challenge is to actually know how these features are *changing together*.

To track changes over time of a set of highly correlated features (water quality parameters)

How have I approached it?

Most people involved with data science know PCA (principal component analysis) as a method of unsupervised learning. It is also used for dimensionality reduction. But particularly, I think PCAs are powerful tools for dataviz and I used them in almost every analysis during the exploratory phase.


Some code and useful libraries/packages that helped me (in R)
