The health or quality of an environment is accessed by monitoring multiple features. PCAs can help to detect and visualize trends over time


So, for water quality for instance, it might not be enough just to know that the concentration of nitrates is decreasing, or that the dissolved oxygen is increasing. The gist is to actually know how these features are *changing together*.


The challenge  

To track changes over time of a set of highly correlated features (water quality parameters)

How have I approached it?

Most people involved with data science know PCA (principal component analysis) as a method of unsupervised learning. It is also used for dimensionality reduction. But particularly,
I think PCAs are powerful tools for dataviz.


Some code and useful libraries/packages that helped me (in R)
