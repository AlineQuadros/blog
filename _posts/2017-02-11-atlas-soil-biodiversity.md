2015 was the United Nations International Year of Soils, and one of its landmarks was the publication of The Global Soil Biodiversity Atlas. It brings illustrations and precious information on the amazing soil creatures of our planet, including the woodlice

The **Global Soil Biodiversity Atlas** was organized by the **European Commission**, **IPBES** (Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services), and the **Global Soil Biodiversity Initiative**. Together with Martin Zimmer I contributed to Atlas with a chapter on ***woodlice***, which you can read below.

Here's some ___key facts___ about soil biodiversity extracted from the Atlas:

* 99 % of the worldâ€™s food comes from the terrestrial environment
* soils hold over a quarter of global biodiversity
* Millions of soil-dwelling organisms promote essential ecosystem services
* Only 1 % of soil microorganism species have been identified

### Woodlice

> Woodlice are key players in the soil's carbon cycling. They are voracious animals that eat decomposing leaves and transform them into a substrate that can be processed faster by the microbiota in the soil.

Here's the Global Soil Biodiversity Atlas *abstract*:

> Soils provide numerous ecosystem services. Most people do not know that the key drivers of soil ecosystems are the living organisms within the soil. Soils may be home to over one fourth of all living species on Earth, with a significant part not yet characterized. The first Global Soil Biodiversity Atlas is a product of the Global Soil Biodiversity Initiative. It aims at raising awareness of the importance and beauty of soil biodiversity among the general public and policy makers. Furthermore, it highlights the need to increase efforts to develop a global assessment of soil biodiversity. Data on distribution of soil-dwelling organisms are often difficult to combine. The atlas represents an attempt to create a unique network among soil biodiversity scientists. Such an effort may help in reaching the level of attention that research on soil biodiversity deserves. With contributions from over 80 experts in soil biodiversity from all over the world, and over 170 pages, the atlas will also display distribution maps of the main soil organisms. Furthermore, an exceptionally high number of images will allow non-specialists to get in touch with this fascinating and mysterious world.
