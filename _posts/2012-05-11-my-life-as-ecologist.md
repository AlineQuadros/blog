**Ecologists** want to understand how all the living things (animals, plants, microorganisms..) are affected and affect the environment that surrounds them. **Quantitative ecologists**, as you might have guessed, do that using tons of biological data, modelling tools and statistics.

 <span class="spoiler">Although it's not part of an ecologist's job, I've discovered and described a new species of woodlice when I was a master student. The species is called *Alboscia itapuensis* </span>
